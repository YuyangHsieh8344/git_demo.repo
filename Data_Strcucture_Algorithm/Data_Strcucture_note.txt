1. Data Structure => is a way of organizing data
different ways of storing data on your computer 
	EX: is like preparing for cooking you slice up vegetables

2. Algorithm => the process that does something to data to produce the 	output
operations on different data structure 
data structure + algorithm = programming 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 to learn:
	a.. Big O notation => is the language of analyzing algorithms 	and data structures.
	b. Data structures list:
		1.Arrays
		2. Linked Lists
		3.Queues and Stacks
		4. Trees
		5. Graphs
		6. Hash Maps
		7. pointers
		8. Memory  => 1 byte = 8 bits
	c. Algorithms:
		1. recursion
		2. sorting algorithms
		3. Graph search algorithms
		4. Dynamic programming
		5. common problem solving patterns

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Memory (RAM) vs. Storage
After turning off the computer, Storage is permanent, and memory will disappear.

int a =1;  => 32 bits for int 
4 bytes = 32 bits = 1 integer

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. classes and objects

//class
class Robot {
	string name;
	string color;
	int weight;
//constructors 
	Robot(String n, String c, int w){
		this.name = n;
		this.color = c;
		this.weight = w;
	}
//function
	void introduceSelf(){
		system.out.println("My name is " + this.name);
	}

}

 
//to use contructors and functions 
Robot r1 = new robot("Leo", "Red", "37");
r1.introduceSelf();

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorting 
	1. Quicksort is typically the fastest for large datasets due to 	its low overhead and excellent average-case performance.

	2. Mergesort is a good choice when stability is required and for 	data that doesn't fit in memory (external sorting).

	3. Heapsort provides reliable O(nlogn) performance with in-place 	sorting but is generally outperformed by quicksort and mergesort.

	4. Timsort is highly efficient for real-world data and is used in 	many standard libraries due to its adaptive nature and stability.
