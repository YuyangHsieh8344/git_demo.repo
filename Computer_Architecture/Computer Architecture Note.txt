Computer Architecture Note
1. 
Equality:
	if A = B, A-B = 0 and Z = 1; else Z = 0.

Greater than /less than:
	if A < B, A - B < 0 and N =1; else N = 0.

2.
load => read value from data memory and put in a register 
store => take value from register and put it back to data memory

3.
The opcode bits determine whether an and, or, subtraction, or addition operation will be performed.

4.
The load immediate command loads a constant value directly into a register, embedding the number in the machine language instruction.

ldi <dst register> , <value>
