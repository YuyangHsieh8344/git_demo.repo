Computer Architecture Note

a. install MPLAB X IDE
https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide#tabs

b. xc8 compiler download

c. download PLCSimLab 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/picsim/

d. create projects:
AVR128DB28 -> simulators

e. source files -> create assemply.s 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. 
Equality:
	if A = B, A-B = 0 and Z = 1; else Z = 0.

Greater than /less than:
	if A < B, A - B < 0 and N =1; else N = 0.

2.
load => read value from data memory and put in a register 
store => take value from register and put it back to data memory

3.
The opcode bits determine whether an and, or, subtraction, or addition operation will be performed.

4.
The load immediate command loads a constant value directly into a register, embedding the number in the machine language instruction.

ldi <dst register> , <value>

5. stack 
is a region of data memory used to store information (i.e. variables) to run a function.
start of stack address => 0x7fff
SRAM memory = 0x4000

6. r2 - r17 and r28-r29 are called saved registers
if callee wants to use these registers, it must first save their value to stack
before returning, the original value of the registers must to stored


7. r18 - r27 and r30-r31 are call-used registers,
A Calle can overwrite these registers and does not have to restore their original values.

8. Temporary registers
r0 => can be overwritten by C functions but must be preserved by interrupts.
All Zero registers
r1 -> initialize to all zeros. it can be overwritten but must be stored to all zeros.

r1
