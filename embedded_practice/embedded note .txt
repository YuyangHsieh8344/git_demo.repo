Tansmitting DATA as the SPI slave
1. to put into slave mode (default), configure UCMST = 0

2. REMEMBER the slave doesn't provide a clock, so there is 
NO UCSSEL and BRW set up needed.

3. SCLK comes into the peripheral from the external master.

4. clock phase and polarity DO need to be configured.

5. the data framing and STE behavior needs to match the master
	a. 3-pin vs 4-pin
	b. STE polarity 
	c. LSB vs. MSB
	d. 6-bit vs. 7-bit

6. wait for the RXIFG IRQ to fire

7. READ Rx buffer
