*UART is slower since it doesn't have a clock 


Tansmitting DATA as the SPI slave
1. to put into slave mode (default), configure UCMST = 0

2. REMEMBER the slave doesn't provide a clock, so there is 
NO UCSSEL and BRW set up needed.

3. SCLK comes into the peripheral from the external master.

4. clock phase and polarity DO need to be configured.

5. the data framing and STE behavior needs to match the master
	a. 3-pin vs 4-pin
	b. STE polarity 
	c. LSB vs. MSB
	d. 6-bit vs. 7-bit

6. wait for the RXIFG IRQ to fire

7. READ Rx buffer

IRC (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a serial interface that implement 
with a two-wire link that can support multiple masters and multiple slaves 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I2C is faster than UART since it using SCK as a clock and UART does not have one
1. I2C communication relies on two lines: SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock). These lines use an open-drain or open-collector configuration, which means that the devices connected to the bus can pull the lines low but cannot drive them high. Pull-up resistors are used to pull the lines to a logic high state when they are not being actively driven low by any device. This establishes the logic high voltage level on the bus.

2. I2C slave addresses can either be 7-bit(default) or 10-bit

3. 0 is write/ 1 is read 

4. SCL pull low to start SDA pull high to START
